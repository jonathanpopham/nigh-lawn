My friends and I have been working on several projects that rely on 
non-relational databases, specifically Google Cloud Platform. We
would like to develop with web components, because we see that as the
future of the internet. On request for how to do HTTP via Polymer,
I was told there was no such thing written yet. Nylon is my side-project,
the goal of which is to create a RESTful service written with Polymer so
my friends and I can make richer applications.


If you got HTTP problems I feel bad for you son,
I got 99 problems but 200 OK ain't one
